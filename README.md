# PIC18-Projects-Repository
PIC microcontroller projects from Dogan Ibrahim's book implemented in C using MPLAB X IDE and Proteus

1. Stepper Motor Control - Simple Unipolar Drive (unipolar_stepper_motor.c). A unipolar stepper motor is used and the motor is rotated 100 turns before it is then stopped. https://youtu.be/mTZW4wvh8Gs

2. Stepper Motor Control - Complex Control of Unipolar Motor (complex_control_unipolar_stepper_motor.c). A unipolar stepper motor is used and the motor is rotated 20 revolutions clockwise, delay of 5s, 5 revolutions anticlockwise, delay of 3s, 10 revolutions clockwise, delay of 1s then stop. https://youtu.be/FunM3NzO7Dw

3. Stepper Motor Control - Simple Bipolar Motor Drive (bipolar_stepper_motor.c). A bipolar stepper motor is used and the motor is rotated 10 revolutions clockwise, delay of 5s, 10 revolutions anticlockwise and then stopped. https://youtu.be/qVl8OQfqO_Y

4. DC Motor Control - Simple Motor Drive. The project is about controlling the direction of rotation of a DC motor. One push-button controls the direction and the other one stars/stops the motor. Weak pull-ups are used on PORT B. https://youtu.be/ZvYFq0oZyY8
